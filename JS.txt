function:
if we write directly write the code it will execute each time when we refresh the code. to avoid that we use function so when we call it that time only it will get  execute.
=>function getData(param){
	console.log("data sent to caller "+ param);
	}
=> to call it - getData(param);
check ways to invoke a function.
=>dom object- (document object model) generated by js engine. with the help of document we can access the property like "document.getElementById("name").value".
by this we get the data from html to js but to send the data FROM js to html we use inner text like "document.getElementById("header").innerText=user.name".
